        <h2>My Favorite Animals</h2>
        <p>Here are my top three favorite animals, each with their own unique charm:</p>

        <ol class="animal-list">
            <li>
                <strong>Dogs</strong>: Dogs are truly amazingâ€”so cute, loyal, and playful. They are undoubtedly the best companions for humans. Their loyalty and affection make them the most wonderful pets and friends.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Rabbits</strong>: Rabbits are incredibly soft and have the cutest little paws. They are quiet but surprisingly playful, making them the perfect mix of calm and active. I had a rabbit when I was younger, and it was one of the best memories of my childhood.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Birds</strong>: Birds come in all shapes and sizes, with the most beautiful feathers. I think they are the most graceful and colorful animals.
            </li>
        </ol>
