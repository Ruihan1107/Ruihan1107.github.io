        <h2>A Story Behind a Trait</h2>
        <p>My mom once told me that I have a faint scar on my back. When I was a baby, my mom had placed me on the bed as I was learning to roll over for the first time. Unfortunately, I ended up rolling right onto a hot kettle, which caused a burn. Though it was a scary moment for my mom, she took great care of me, and the scar healed quite well over time.To this day, I don't notice the scar myself, but my mom says there's a slight discoloration there.</p>
