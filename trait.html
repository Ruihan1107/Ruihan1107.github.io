        <h2>A Story Behind a Trait</h2>
        <p>My mom once told me that I have a faint scar on my back, a reminder of a childhood accident. When I was a baby, my mom had placed me on the bed as I was learning to roll over for the first time. Unfortunately, I ended up rolling right onto a hot kettle, which caused a burn. Though it was a scary moment for my mom, she took great care of me, and the scar healed quite well over time.</p>
        <p>To this day, I don't notice the scar myself, but my mom says there's a slight discoloration there. It's one of those small things that I don't really think about, but it's a story that always reminds me of my mom's love and care during my childhood. It's a quiet yet significant mark that connects me to a moment in time when she protected me with all her heart.</p>
